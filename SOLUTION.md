# Solution: Fix for Microsoft Graph Universal Print 404 Errors

## Quick Summary

Your Microsoft Graph Universal Print integration is failing with 404 errors when trying to create documents or upload sessions, even though the print job was created successfully.

**Root Cause**: Missing `PrinterShare.ReadWrite.All` permission

**Solution**: Add the `PrinterShare.ReadWrite.All` application permission to your Azure AD app registration and grant admin consent.

## Immediate Action Required

1. **Add Permission in Azure Portal**:
   - Navigate to: Azure Portal → Azure Active Directory → App registrations → Your App
   - Go to "API permissions"
   - Click "Add a permission" → Microsoft Graph → Application permissions
   - Search for and select: `PrinterShare.ReadWrite.All`
   - Click "Grant admin consent for [your tenant]"
   - Wait 2-5 minutes for the permission to propagate

2. **Re-run Your Print Job**:
   ```bash
   python up_print.py --printer-id "fb9f7465-597e-4ebf-990a-510052930107" \
                      --file "low.pdf" \
                      --debug
   ```

## Why This Happens

The Microsoft Graph API has a quirk where:
- `PrintJob.ReadWrite.All` allows you to CREATE print jobs
- But `PrinterShare.ReadWrite.All` is often required to ADD DOCUMENTS to those jobs

This is a common issue that affects many Universal Print integrations and is well-documented in Microsoft support forums.

## What Was Fixed in the Code

I've enhanced your `up_print.py` script with better diagnostics to help identify this and similar issues:

### 1. Added Printer Capabilities Check
- Shows which content types your printer supports
- Warns if your document format may not be supported
- Helps identify format mismatch issues

### 2. Enhanced Error Reporting
- Shows complete error response bodies from Microsoft Graph
- Includes all request IDs for support cases
- Displays job status after creation

### 3. Added Fallback Endpoints
- Automatically tries alternative API endpoints
- Attempts `/print/jobs/{jobId}/documents` if primary path fails
- Verifies job accessibility via multiple paths

### 4. Better Documentation
- Updated README with clear permission requirements
- Added comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- Created this solution document

## Expected Behavior After Fix

Once you add the `PrinterShare.ReadWrite.All` permission, you should see:

```
[debug] printer ok: fb9f7465-597e-4ebf-990a-510052930107 test-printer
[debug] printer supported content types: ["application/pdf","application/oxps",...]
[debug] printer defaults: {...}
[debug] job configuration: {...}
Created job 15
[debug] resolved contentType: application/pdf (source=extension)
[debug] job ok: 15
[debug] POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/print/printers/.../jobs/15/documents/createUploadSession
Uploading document...
Upload complete.
Starting job...
Job started.
```

## Alternative Solutions

If adding the permission doesn't resolve the issue:

### Check Document Format
Your printer may not support PDF. Try:
1. Check the printer's supported content types in debug output
2. Convert your document to OXPS format
3. Use `--content-type application/oxps` if you've converted the file

### Check Authentication Type
You're currently using delegated permissions (visible in your token scopes). For production:
- Use application permissions with client credentials flow (`--auth app`)
- Ensure your service principal has proper permissions
- Verify your user account has access to the printer if using delegated auth

### Verify Printer Configuration
- Ensure the printer is properly registered in Universal Print
- Check that your tenant allows Universal Print access
- Verify no security groups are restricting printer access

## Testing the Fix

After adding the permission, test with:

```bash
# Minimal test
python up_print.py --printer-id "fb9f7465-597e-4ebf-990a-510052930107" \
                   --file "low.pdf"

# With full diagnostics
python up_print.py --printer-id "fb9f7465-597e-4ebf-990a-510052930107" \
                   --file "low.pdf" \
                   --debug \
                   --poll
```

## Support

If you continue to experience issues after adding the permission:

1. Collect the full debug output
2. Note the request-id and client-request-id from error messages
3. Check the supported content types in the debug output
4. Refer to TROUBLESHOOTING_404.md for detailed diagnostic steps

**TL;DR**: Add `PrinterShare.ReadWrite.All` permission to your Azure AD app, grant admin consent, wait 2-5 minutes, then retry. This permission is required to add documents to print jobs.
