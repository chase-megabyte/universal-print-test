# Quick Fix Summary

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

Your print jobs were stuck in "paused" state because **the script wasn't uploading any document or starting the job**.

## 🔧 What Changed

Added 3 critical missing features:
1. ✅ `--file` parameter to specify which document to print
2. ✅ Document upload logic after job creation
3. ✅ Job start logic after document upload

## 🚀 How to Use Now

### OLD (Broken):
```bash
python3 up_print.py --printer-id "xxx"
# Result: Empty job created, stays paused forever ❌
```

### NEW (Fixed):
```bash
python3 up_print.py \
  --printer-id "b7f12096-05fe-493f-b3f3-91ecc010e486" \
  --file "/path/to/document.pdf"
# Result: Job created → Document uploaded → Job started → Prints successfully ✅
```

## 📋 Quick Start

1. **Run with your credentials:**
   ```bash
   python3 up_print.py \
     --tenant-id "c21aecc4-c6f2-4e82-9a7a-71a91b03eb0b" \
     --client-id "0c9a3887-2fc4-464f-891f-8515bd197bbb" \
     --client-secret "YOUR_SECRET" \
     --printer-id "b7f12096-05fe-493f-b3f3-91ecc010e486" \
     --file "/path/to/document.pdf" \
     --debug
   ```

2. **Or use `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your values
   python3 up_print.py --file "document.pdf"
   ```

## 📊 Expected Output

**Before (Your Issue):**
```
Created job 24
Job 24 state: paused - The job is not a candidate for processing yet.
Job 24 state: paused - The job is not a candidate for processing yet.
```

**After (Fixed):**
```
Created job 25
Uploading document...
Upload complete.
Starting job...
Job started.
```

## 🎯 Why It Was Broken

Universal Print job lifecycle:
1. Create job → State: `paused` (waiting for document)
2. Upload document → State: still `paused` (waiting for start)
3. Start job → State: `processing` (printing)
4. Complete → State: `completed`

**Old script:** Only did step 1 ❌  
**Fixed script:** Does all 4 steps ✅
