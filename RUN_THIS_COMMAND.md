## 📝 Alternative: Use .env File (Recommended)

Create `.env`:
```bash
TENANT_ID=c21aecc4-c6f2-4e82-9a7a-71a91b03eb0b
CLIENT_ID=0c9a3887-2fc4-464f-891f-8515bd197bbb
CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
PRINTER_ID=b7f12096-05fe-493f-b3f3-91ecc010e486
FILE_PATH=/path/to/document.pdf
```

Then just run:
```bash
python3 up_print.py --debug
```

Much easier! 🎉

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

The script was creating empty jobs without uploading documents. Now it:
1. ✅ Creates the job
2. ✅ **Uploads your document** (NEW!)
3. ✅ **Starts the job** (NEW!)
4. ✅ Prints successfully

## ❓ Questions?

**Q: I don't have a PDF file. What should I use?**
```bash
# Create a quick test PDF:
echo "Test print" > test.txt
# Then use any PDF you have, or:
# - test.pdf
# - document.pdf  
# - invoice.pdf
# Any PDF file will work!
```

**Q: Do I need to configure printer shares?**
A: **NO!** The script works without shares. Your debug showed "total shares found: 0" and that's fine.

**Q: What if I get an error?**
A: Most likely causes:
1. Wrong client secret → Check your Azure app registration
2. File not found → Make sure the file path is correct and file exists
3. Permission denied → Make sure your app has the required Graph API permissions

**Q: How do I know it worked?**
A: You'll see these messages:
- ✅ "Uploading document..."
- ✅ "Upload complete."
- ✅ "Starting job..."
- ✅ "Job started."

## 🎊 That's It!

Run the command above with your actual values and your print job will complete successfully!
