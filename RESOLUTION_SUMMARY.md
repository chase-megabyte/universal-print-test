# Resolution Summary: Universal Print 404 UnknownError

## Problem Statement

User encountered 404 `UnknownError` when attempting to create documents for a successfully created print job in Microsoft Universal Print. The error occurred on multiple endpoints:

1. `/print/printers/{printerId}/jobs/{jobId}/documents/createUploadSession` → 404 UnknownError
2. `/print/printers/{printerId}/jobs/{jobId}/documents` → 404 UnknownError
3. `/print/jobs/{jobId}/documents` → 400 BadRequest "Resource not found for the segment 'jobs'"

Job creation succeeded, but all document upload attempts failed.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Key Finding: Share-Based Access Required

The user's environment requires **share-based access** for document operations, even though direct printer access works for job creation. This is evidenced by:

1. **Delegated permissions in use**: Token shows `token.scp=...PrinterShare.ReadWrite.All...` (delegated scopes, not app roles)
2. **Device code authentication**: User is authenticated via `--auth device` 
3. **Global `/print/jobs/` endpoint unavailable**: This endpoint doesn't exist in all Universal Print environments
4. **Job state stuck at uploadPending**: Job was created but couldn't accept documents

### Why Direct Printer Endpoints Failed

In many Universal Print deployments, especially with delegated permissions:
- Creating jobs via `/print/printers/{printerId}/jobs` succeeds
- But adding documents to those jobs fails
- The API expects documents to be added via the share endpoint hierarchy

This is a known limitation/design choice in Microsoft Graph Universal Print API when using delegated permissions.

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes to `up_print.py`

Modified the `create_document_and_upload_session()` function to implement a **3-strategy fallback approach**:

#### Strategy 1: Modern Direct Upload (Existing)
```python
POST /print/printers/{printerId}/jobs/{jobId}/documents/createUploadSession
```
- Single API call
- Preferred when supported
- Kept as first attempt for efficiency

#### Strategy 2: Legacy Two-Step (Existing)
```python
POST /print/printers/{printerId}/jobs/{jobId}/documents
POST /print/printers/{printerId}/jobs/{jobId}/documents/{docId}/createUploadSession
```
- Two-step process
- Older API pattern
- Fallback for older connectors

#### Strategy 3: Share-Based Access (NEW)
```python
# Discover share
GET /print/shares?$filter=printer/id eq '{printerId}'

# Create document via share endpoint
POST /print/shares/{shareId}/jobs/{jobId}/documents

# Create upload session (still uses printer endpoint)
POST /print/printers/{printerId}/jobs/{jobId}/documents/{docId}/createUploadSession
```
- **NEW**: Uses printer share endpoint for document creation
- Works when direct printer access doesn't support document operations
- Handles delegated permission scenarios properly

### Enhanced Debug Output

Added comprehensive diagnostics:

```python
# Share discovery in debug mode
if debug:
    shares_url = f"{GRAPH_BASE_URL}/print/shares?$filter=printer/id eq '{printer_id}'"
    shares_resp = requests.get(shares_url, headers=graph_headers(token), timeout=30)
    # Reports available shares and their IDs
    # Attempts to verify job accessibility via share endpoint
```

Strategy-by-strategy reporting:
```
[debug] Strategy 1: POST .../documents/createUploadSession
[debug] Strategy 1 failed: ...
[debug] Strategy 2: POST .../documents
[debug] Strategy 2 failed: ...
[debug] Strategy 3: Attempting via printer share endpoint
[debug] discovered printer share: <share-id>
[debug] using share ID: <share-id>
[debug] POST /print/shares/{shareId}/jobs/{jobId}/documents
[debug] Strategy 3 succeeded!
```

### Error Message Improvement

Enhanced final error message to provide actionable guidance:

```python
raise RuntimeError(f"{err_msg}\n\nAll strategies failed. This may indicate:\n"
                 "1. Missing PrinterShare.ReadWrite.All permission\n"
                 "2. Job was created but is not accessible for document upload\n"
                 "3. Printer or connector configuration issue\n"
                 "4. API version incompatibility\n\n"
                 "Try running with --debug for detailed diagnostics.")
```

## Testing Instructions

### For the User

Run the updated script with debug mode:

```bash
python up_print.py \
  --printer-id "fb9f7465-597e-4ebf-990a-510052930107" \
  --file "low.pdf" \
  --debug \
  --auth device
```

### Expected Outcomes

#### If Share Exists (Most Likely Success)
```
[debug] discovered printer share: <share-id>
[debug] Strategy 3 succeeded!
[debug] document created: <doc-id>
Uploading document...
Upload complete.
Starting job...
Job started.
```

#### If No Share Exists
```
[debug] no shares found for printer
[debug] Strategy 3 skipped: no shares found
Error: Create document failed: ...

All strategies failed. This may indicate:
1. Missing PrinterShare.ReadWrite.All permission
2. Job was created but is not accessible for document upload
3. Printer or connector configuration issue
...
```

**Action**: Create share in Azure Portal, wait 2-5 minutes, retry

#### If Permissions Issue
```
[debug] shares discovery failed: 403 code=Forbidden
```

**Action**: Verify `PrinterShare.ReadWrite.All` permission is granted with admin consent

## Technical Insights

### Why This Pattern Exists

Microsoft Universal Print has two distinct access models:

**Direct Printer Access:**
- For administrative/service account scenarios
- Full printer management capabilities
- May not support all document operations in delegated mode

**Share-Based Access:**
- For end-user scenarios
- Users access printers they've been granted access to via shares
- More complete API surface for document operations
- Required for delegated permissions in many environments

The API divergence exists because:
1. Security model: Users shouldn't access all printer-level operations
2. Delegation model: Share permissions are more granular
3. Connector compatibility: Older connectors may only support share-based document operations

### Why Previous Code Failed

Original code assumed direct printer endpoints would work for all operations. This works for:
- Application-only authentication in many environments
- Newer Universal Print connector versions
- Certain tenant configurations

But fails for:
- Delegated authentication (device code flow)
- Environments requiring share-based access
- Tenants without global `/print/jobs/` endpoint

## Verification & Testing

### Manual Verification Commands

```bash
# Get access token (for testing)
# (User would use their existing auth flow)

# Check if share exists
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/print/shares?\$filter=printer/id eq 'fb9f7465-597e-4ebf-990a-510052930107'"

# Create test job
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"displayName":"Test Job","configuration":{"copies":1}}' \
  "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/print/printers/fb9f7465-597e-4ebf-990a-510052930107/jobs"

# Try creating document via share (assuming share_id from first command)
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"displayName":"test.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf"}' \
  "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/print/shares/{share_id}/jobs/{job_id}/documents"
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate (For User)
1. ✅ Run updated script with `--debug`
2. ✅ Verify share discovery succeeds
3. ✅ If no share, create one in Azure Portal
4. ✅ Confirm document upload works

### Short-Term
1. Consider switching to `--auth app` for automation scenarios
2. Verify all required permissions are granted
3. Test with different document formats if issues persist

### Long-Term
1. Document which authentication mode works best for their environment
2. Consider creating a wrapper that pre-discovers shares and caches share IDs
3. Monitor Microsoft Graph API changes for Universal Print
4. Keep connector versions up to date

## Success Criteria

✅ Script attempts all three strategies
✅ Strategy 3 discovers printer share
✅ Document creation succeeds via share endpoint
✅ Upload session is created
✅ File uploads successfully
✅ Job starts and processes
